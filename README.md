# IBC Project Fall 20

## Group Name:  FoodCapsule

### Problem Statement: 
Have you ever found yourself craving for some good dish but haven’t got the  proper recipe for the dish? And did you ever find yourself at a fancy restaurant 
because you are unable to cook the same quality food yourself, and even after  paying those heavy, you aren't sure that you ate the authentic traditional dish? You 
only faced these problems because there isn't any mechanism to store these  traditional artifacts and be accessible to everyone.  
 
### Our Solution: 
Let us propose something. Suppose you're settled in Islamabad and one day  you want to drink this “gur wali chai” which everyone in your social circle is talking 
about. While the thought of having “gur wali chai” in the cold weather makes you want to rush to your nearest store and have that special tea, but the idea of paying 
Rs. 250 for a single cup of tea and whether that will tea will be made out of “pure gur”, still leaves a question in your mind. However, suppose if there was a website 
where all of the traditional or modern dish recipes are available within just 2-3 clicks  and where the authenticity can also be backtracked till its date of origin, wouldn’t 
that be a true lifesaver?  
Well, this is our Blockchain Project “ FoodCapsule ”, which will serve as a time  capsule for these dishes. It will store every dish’s recipe, date of origin, significance 
etc in a public blockchain, which will be accessible to everyone via FoodCapsule’s  website. 

### Technical Aspects: 
1. The repository of FoodCapusle is linked with Ethereum Blockchain with a frontend designed using React Framework. 
2. Ganache’s blockchain is used to store the ledger. 
3. The deployment of smart contracts is carried out using truffle. 
4. Smart contract is linked with the React framework, web3.js. 

### How to run the app:  
1. Open Ganache workspace and make sure it's connected with your metamask account.
2. Once Ganache is running, open the project folder and deploy “FoodCapsule.sol” using truffle. 
3. Once “FoodCapsule.sol” is deployed, open a new terminal in the same project folder and start the react app using node package manager, by using the 
following command: 
“npm run start” 
4. When the FoodCapsule homepage is visible on your web browser, you’ll be 
presented with different functionality, which you can choose as per your wish.
